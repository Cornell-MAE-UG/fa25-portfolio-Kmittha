#### Projects
- **MAE 4300: Final Project**:  
  *The MAE 4300 Final Reflection examines how engineering decisions shape societal outcomes, using the Boeing 737 Max crisis as a case study. It integrates ethics, sustainability, and regulatory frameworks to explore the broader responsibilities of engineering in promoting safety, equity, and public trust across technological systems.*  

- **MAE 4272: Blade Design Report**:  
  *The MAE 4272 blade design report presents the full development process for a small-scale wind turbine operating under a Weibull wind distribution. It details geometric constraints, selecting operating speed, aerodynamic reasoning, CAD modeling, and perfomance metrics, along with a preliminary testing protocol designed to evaluate efficiency, structural reliational, and alignment with project requirements.*  
  - Key Achievement: All constraints (geometric, bending stress, allowable torque) met.
