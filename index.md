## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am an aspiring engineering student with hands-on experience in mechanical testing, project coordination, and system-level problem solving. I thrive at the itersection of technical rigor and creative design. My academic work has strengthened my interest in renewable energy systems, product development, and the broader societal impact of engineering decisions. Beyond the classroom, I serve as President of the Society of Women Engineers, contribute to the Society of India, participate in CUAUV Project team, represent the College of Engineering as an ambassador, and support student learning as a TA/PA for multiple MAE courses. 

I am completing my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering while pursuing a Master's in Engineering Management, a combination that reflects my long-term goal of moving into sustainability-focused product management. This dual path allows me to pair strong technical foundations with strategic thinking, leadership, and an understanding of how engineering solutions scale in real-world environments. Outside of academics, I find balance through reading, knitting, and spending time with friends. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to teams developing climate-conscious technologies and translating them into accessible, impactful solutions that support a more sustainable future.
