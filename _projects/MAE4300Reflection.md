**Holistic Analysis of the Boeing 737 Max Ethical Failure**

This semester, in MAE 4300, the Boeing 737 Max crisis served as a case study to examine how engineering decisions shape societal outcomes. This crisis initially appeared as a technical malfunction with the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), but it ultimately revealed an interconnected web of design shortcuts, organizational pressures, regulatory breakdowns, and cultural failures. Understanding the incident holistically requires looking beyond the software itself and examining the broader ecosystem of decisions, incentives, and assumptions that shaped Boeing and its key stakeholder’s choices. 

The technical facts surrounding the 737 Max reveal an inherently flawed system. MCAS relied on a single angle-of-attack (AoA) sensor creating a single point of failure in a mission-critical system. Boeing expanded the MCAS activation to low-Mach numbers without adequate testing, and aerodynamic changes caused by engine repositioning increased the aircraft’s tendency to pitch upwards (National Transportation Safety Board, 2020). Both of these made MCAS more central to the flight operation than the original scope intended (Larcker & Tayan, 2024). Compounding these technical issues, the FAA approved the aircraft without requiring simulator training for pilots, and Boeing's internal certificaiton processes allowed 96% of the aircraft to be apprvoed by Boeing-employed designated engineering representatives (DERs) rather than independent regulators. These technical decision had direct consequences for stakeholders: pilots were not informed of the MCAS, airlines assumed the new aircraft model behaved like the previous ones, and passengers unknowingly boarded planes with hidden vulnerabilities. 

Individual decisions throughout the MCAS development process amplied these technical risks. Boeing's chief technical pilot, Mark Forkner, withheld information about MCAS from the reulators in order to avoid costly training requirements (U.S. Department of Justice, 2021). Senior executives, including CEO Dennis Muilenburg, pressured the FAA to accelerate certification and deliveries, prioritizing market gain over engineering caution (Kitroeff et al., 2019). Engineers and Boeing DERs approved MCAS changes despite limited testing and incomplete understanding of the expanded MCAS scope (Sterman & Quinn, 2024). These actions reflected a company culture that prioritized corporate goals over professional responsibility.

Organizational structures and incentives have created an environment where ethical engineering became difficult. Boeing engineers reported working at twice the normal pace, reducing time for validation and cross-team communication (Sterman & Quinn, 2024). Boeing had promised Southwest Airlines financial incentives tied to avoiding simulator training, creating pressure to downplay MCAS's significance (Larcker & Tayan, 2024). Furthermore, Boeing DERs were subject to managerial influence, and whistleblowers emphasized retaliatory disciplinary action, illustrating a culture that discouraged transparency. 

Missing information and reasonable assumptions also played a role in shaping the risk landscape. Engineers may have raised concerns throughout the development process that were ignored/overriden, given the speed of development and fragmented communication channels. Airlines trusted Boeing's reputation and assumed regulatory rigor, while DERs may have assumed sensor redundancy, and overall these assumptions created information silos and allowed vulnerabilities to propagate unchecked. 

Furthermore, evaluating this case through ASME ethical canons reveal consistent violations. Canon 1, which requires engineers to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public, was repeatedly deemed secondary to financial and competitive pressures. Canon 7, requiring truthful communication, was comprised when Boeing withheld MCAS details from pilots and FAA regulators. Canon 2, requiring engineers to work within their areas of competence, was violated when DERs approved changes without full technical understanding. Canon 9, which prohibits retaliation among engineers, was undermined by a culture that discouraged whistleblowing. Across all issues, Canon 1 takes precedence, and its violation lies at the center of the Boeing 737 Max case. 

Preventing similar failures requires interventions at multiple levels. Individually, engineers need stronger ethics training, clearer understanding of certification processes, and professional netwroks that support ethical dissent. Organizationally, Boeing must establish independent safety review boards, reduce workload pressures, standardize documentation, and strengthen whistleblower protections. Systemically, the FAA must reduce reliance on manufacturer-delegated certification, coordinate internationally on safety standards, and require periodic ethics training across the industry. These reforms directly address the constraints that enabled the 737 Max failures. 

In conclusion, the Boeing 737 Max crisis was not the result of a single design flaw or isolated misconduct. It was the outcome of a system where tehcnical shortcuts, organizational pressures, regulatory gaps, and cultural failures aligned to undermine the core ethical obligations of engineerings. A holistic analysis shows that this tragedy could have been prevented at multiple points - through better design, clearer communication, and stronger oversight. Ultimately, the case underscores that engineering ethics is not an abstact ideal but a lived responsibility with life-and-death consequences.
